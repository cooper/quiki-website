quiki's [b][[ git | https://git-scm.com ]][/b] integration makes it easy to manage
revisions of a website.

By using git to track your changes, you can

list {
	Revert specific changes (such as malicious ones), usually automatically
		even if other independent changes have occurred since.;
	Compare versions to see how content has changed over time.;
	Determine which changes are attributed to specific users.;
}

[How it works] {
	The most trivial revisioning insists that each specific change is
	committed independently of other changes. That allows the change to
	be selectively applied and reverted later. From the command line,
	this is achieved like so:

	code {{
		nano -w pages/my.page		# User edits a page
		git add pages/my.page		# User adds these changes
		git commit -m "Edited my page"	# User commits the change with a justification
	}}

	More advanced users can draft versions of the website before
	publishing them by using branches:

	code {{
		git checkout -b mychanges	# User creates and checks out new branch
		nano -w pages/my.page		# User edits a page
		git add pages/my.page		# User adds these changes
		git commit -m "Rough draft"	# User commits the change to the new branch only
	}}

	Other changes are committed until the branch is ready to publish. Then,

	code {{
		git checkout master		# User returns to master branch (public website)
		git merge mychanges		# User merges in the changes
	}}
}

[adminifier integration] {
	[[adminifier]] seamlessly integrates git in a way that's far less
	intimidating to non-technical folk:
	
	list {
		When a user makes edits, a new branch is transparently created
			to allow them to draft and preview their changes.;
		The quiki webserver allows only authenticated users with the
			proper permissions to preview the site in this state,
			at a different URL path than the public-facing site.;
		When a user "Publishes" the changes, the branch is simply
			merged into the master branch. Usually this is an
			automatic procedure, but if conflicts occur, they are
			presented online for the user to resolve.;
	}
}
