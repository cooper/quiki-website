@page.title: It's not just for wikis.;

Just because quiki pages are written in [[ productive, super-legible markup | /doc/language ]]
doesn't mean it's only good for encyclopedias. It's even better for building gorgeous websites
with infinitesimal effort.

[THE OVERVIEW] {
    list {  /* Diamonds. */
        Crystal clear code.;            /* quiki Q and Markdown M with arrow logos side by side */
        Edit on the web.;               /* icons for text formatting/etc */
        Revision tracking.;             /* git logo */
        Load balancing.;                /* multiple servers */
        Super portable.;                /* go gopher? */
    }
}

[THE BREAKDOWN] {
    [Clean. Productive. Clear.] {
        Anyone can read it. Anyone can write it.
        That's the goal of the quiki [[ source language | /doc/language ]]. I like to think of it as
        a better structured, [[ more extensibe | /doc/blocks ]] alternative to Markdown; but if you
        like Markdown more, not to worry[---]quiki serves those files too.
    }

    [Ditch the database.] {
        quiki started as a simple script to convert plain text files to HTML and CSS. Through its
        evolution into a featureful, ready-from-the-box web engine, its backbones remain true to those
        humble beginnings[---]a quiki website can be easily read and written in even the most
        unsophisticated of text editors.
    }

    [Do web work, on the web.] {
        With a built-in administrative web panel, your sites can be configured and edited right in the
        browser. That makes quiki great for all sorts of applications, even blogs whose writers might not
        have the technical know-how to access a text-based editor on the server command line.
    }

    [Draft and redraft.] {
        The nice thing about using plain text files is that amazing tools just so happen to already exist
        for the revision tracking of such files. Each quiki website is a git repository. Use branches to
        draft and preview pages before merging them in for public view. All of this and more in your
        browser or terminal.
    }

    [Let your servers gossip.] {
        It's a new kind of load balancing, one that pretty much takes care of itself. Kindly introduce a
        few quiki servers and leave them to the talking. They'll keep each other in the know about juicy
        new content and fetch the latest right away.
    }

    [It's all one piece.] {
        No dependencies. No confusing setup. There is but one moving part, and that part can move just
        about anywhere. That's the glory of being [[ written in Go | https://github.com/cooper/quiki ]]:
        the entire suite is compiled into one self-contained, ultra portable binary.
