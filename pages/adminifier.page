[b]adminifier[/b] is quiki's optional site administration panel.
While quiki sites can be easily edited and administered from a command line
text editor, adminifier brings this environment to the web browser and enhances
it with many additional convenient features, such as

list {
	Online page editor with sophisticated autocompletion and fillable forms to generate code;
	Ability to view, compare, and revert specific [[revisions | git]];
	Media upload tool;
	Server administration panel for managing multiple sites;
	Role-based user management for differing authority levels;
	Site and server statistics;
	Site and server configuration editors;
}

[Setup] {
	adminifier is an optional module of the quiki webserver, but no
	additional setup is required. It is enabled
	in the default [[ configuration | doc/configuration ]] with the
	following:

	code{{
		@adminifier.enable;           /* whether to enable adminifier */
		@adminifier.host: ;           /* HTTP host for adminifier. leave blank to use all hosts */
		@adminifier.root: /admin;     /* HTTP root for adminifier. leave blank to use /         */
	}}

	Optionally, you may change [c]adminifier.host[/c] and
	[c]adminifier.root[/c] to configure the HTTP hostname and root path.
}
