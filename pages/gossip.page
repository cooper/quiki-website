[b]Gossip[/b] is a feature within the quiki webserver that implements
decentralized [[ load balancing | wp: Load balancing (computing) ]].

Here's how it works.

numlist {
	User edits a page either with a text editor or online with [[adminifier]].;
	User publishes the change to the public version of the site.;	
	The built-in file monitor detects this change and begins serving it locally.;
	The built-in [[git]] agent pushes this change to a remote.;
	Gossip notifies other servers within the load balancing pool that new changes have been published.;
	Other servers fetch the latest from the remote.;
	Other servers begin serving the updated content.; 
}

This allows very simple and thoughtless load balancing. Make the changes
[i]once[/i]; let the Gossip spread to take care of the rest.
