        In addition to wiki source files, wikifier can serve content from documents
        written in Markdown.
    }
    ~p {
        Markdown files are stored in a dedicated directory, determined by the
        [[ [c]dir.md[/c] | configuration.md#dir ]] directive. As with page files, the wikiserver
        monitors the markdown file directory and generates them immediately upon
        changes.
    }
    ~p {
        Rather than simply injecting the Markdown content as HTML, wikifier parses and
        translates each Markdown file to the wikifier source language. These generated
        wiki source files are then served just like any other page file.
    }
    ~p {
        wikifier uses the [[ cmark | https://github.com/jgm/cmark ]] Markdown parser, which
        implements the [[ CommonMark | http://commonmark.org ]] specification.
    }
    ~sec [Setup] {
        ~p {
            First, you need [[ cmark | https://github.com/jgm/cmark ]]. Follow that link and
            look at the README for details on how to install it, but here is an example
            for a systemwide installation\:
        }
        ~code [bash] {
apt-get install cmake
git clone https://github.com/jgm/cmark
cd cmark
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
make test
make install
}
~p {
            Now install the [[ CommonMark | https://metacpan.org/pod/CommonMark ]] module from
            CPAN\:
        }
        ~code [bash] {
cpanm CommonMark
}
~p {
            If the module from CPAN fails to install, this is likely because it was unable
            to locate cmark on the system.
        }
        
    }
    
}
