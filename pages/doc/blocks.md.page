            [b]Syntax for pairs[/b]. Each pair is separated by a colon ([c]\:[/c]). The left side is
            the key\; the right is the value. The key must be plain text (no formatting
            permitted). Colons ([c]\:[/c]) can be included in the key be prefixing them with the
            escape character ([c]\\[/c]). The value may contain
            [[ formatted text | language.md#text-formatting ]] or a single
            [[ block | language.md#blocks ]] but not both simultaneously. Values are terminated
            with the semicolon ([c]\;[/c]). If the value is text, semicolons can be included by
            prefixing them with the escape character ([c]\\[/c]). Colons ([c]\:[/c]) do not need to be
            escaped in the value.

}
~p {
            [b]Syntax for standalone values[/b]. In addition to pairs, maps can contain
            anonymous values. These are values which are not mapped to a key. Like values in
            pairs, standalone values are terminated by the semicolon ([c]\;[/c]). If the value is
            text, it should be prefixed with a colon ([c]\:[/c]). The advantage of this is that
            colons consequently need not be escaped in the value. For blocks, this prefixing
            colon is not required. Semicolons ([c]\;[/c]) can be included in standalone text
            values by prefixing them with the escape character ([c]\\[/c]).

            [b]Duplicate keys[/b]. As some block types such as [[ [c]infobox\{\}[/c] | #infobox ]] and
            [[ [c]history\{\}[/c] | #history ]] use the pairs of a map to display table rows in the
            generated HTML, keys may be duplicated. When using a key more than once, both
            pairs will be displayed in the resulting HTML, but because only one value can be
            associated with each key internally, duplicate keys are suffixed with [c]_n[/c] where
            [c]n[/c] is incremented for each occurrence, starting at 2.

        ~p {
            You can organize the content of an article by dividing it into sections.
            Sections typically have title headers, except for the first one. The first
            section on a page is considered the introduction. It always has the page title
            as its header, so even if specify some text there, it will not be considered. As
            for the rest, the header will be displayed at the appropriate level.
        }
        ~p {
            Also spelled [c]sec\{\}[/c].
        }
        ~code {
sec \{
    This is my intro section. No need to put a title here, since the page title
    will be displayed atop this section.
\}

sec [Info] \{
    Here we go. This one has a title.

    By the way, a blank line starts a new paragraph.
\}

sec [More stuff] \{
    You can also put sections inside each other.

    sec [Little header] \{
        This section will have a smaller header, since it is nested deeper
        than the top-level sections.
    \}
\}
}
